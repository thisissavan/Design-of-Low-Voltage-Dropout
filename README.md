# Design-of-Low-Voltage-Dropout

- LDO is designed which can give constant output voltage 1.2 V for the input variation from 1.7V to 3.6 V.
- Millar capacitance is used to make the system stable.
- The gain of the system us 61dB.
- The pass element is designed such a way that gate capacitance of the PMOS is less so it will not consume more area.
